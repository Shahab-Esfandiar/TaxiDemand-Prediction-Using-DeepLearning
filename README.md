<h1 id="1.Introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
*__Taxi Demand Prediction__ is a Deep learning application designed to forecast the number of taxi requests in specefic region. in this case, I choose __Manhattan__ in New York and predict demands for the __next week__. The predictions are displayed by city zone and broken down into __hourly__ intervals.*

*So I aimed for my project to be __profitable in the real world__. If a taxi driver could accurately predict which boroughs or areas will have the highest demand, he could optimize his workday by focusing on those areas. This would allow him to either earn more money in the same amount of time or save time for his family and personal life, ultimately improving his quality of life.*

- ***The purpose of this document is to provide a brief overview of the project.***
